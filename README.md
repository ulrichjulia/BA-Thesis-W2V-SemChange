# BA-Thesis-W2V-SemChange

This is the repository for the code of my BA thesis, written in the fall semster 2020 at the University of Zurich, supervised by Prof. Dr. Marianne Hundt.
The topic of the thesis was a diachronic comparison of word embeddings to investigate semantic change, especially on the internet.

**Docstrings** within the scripts explain what each function does.

For the code to work properly, one needs to create some folders within folders with the following structures:
CWD:
>> Data
  >>> Internet
    >>>> _Subcorpus_
      >>>>> _Year_
            *file*
            …
      …
  >>> Offline
    >>>> _Subcorpus_
      >>>>> _Year_
            *file*
            …
      …
 
Have fun reasearching! :)
