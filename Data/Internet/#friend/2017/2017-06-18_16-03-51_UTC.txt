Happy Father's day to my pops.  Thank you for making me. Thank you for giving purpose to my life.  Thank you for being the best father anyone could ever have.  Thank you for all your hard work. Thank you for inspiring me every day to try hard and be the best man I can be. I'd be half the man I am today without you.  Love you pa.
